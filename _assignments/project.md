## Overview

A course project will be a major component of your work.
This will require hands-on experience with HCI, while remaining open to different possibilities.

Because you are still new to HCI research, we do not necessarily expect you to produce publishable work
Instead, the expectation is that you will do something _interesting_.
It is then up to you to define _interesting_ according to what you want to accomplish in this project,
seeking appropriate feedback from staff.
For example, you might choose to:

- Design and implement a new piece of HCI technology.
- Design and execute an appropriately compelling study with HCI research implications.
- Perform a feasibility analysis or pilot study to inform future research plans.
- Replicate an existing technology or study.
- Execute a sufficiently interesting design problem (i.e., focusing on design without regard to research novelty).

We expect most students will do projects in groups of three. 
We will consider groups of two, and very strongly discourage individuals.
Working in groups is a necessary part of doing research, and also important for the logistics of this course.

## Project Deliverables

Project deliverables are defined in terms of a _proposal_, a pair of _self-defined milestones_, and a _final report_.
These are due:

- _Proposal_:       Thursday, January 14, 2016
- _Milestone_:      Thursday, January 28, 2016
- _Milestone_:      Thursday, February 25, 2016
- _Final Report_:   Monday, March 14, 2016

### Proposal

Your proposal will define your initial plan for this project.
You can and should update this plan based on feedback, progress, and findings.
But the proposal needs to demonstrate a robust initial plan for your project.

Course staff will be available to meet and provide feedback on Friday, January 8.
Meeting is optional.
You can also email to request feedback or to inquire about arranging another time to meet.
Sign up for the reserved meeting times here:

You are welcome and even encouraged to align your project with your research goals outside this course.
However, it is critical to define what you will specifically accomplish in the course project.
The course project must stand on its own.

Proposals consist of a short document and a short in-class presentation.

#### Document

Prepare a one-page document addressing the following points:

- What makes the project interesting? What is the problem or research question?

  What is the pain point you want to solve, the new capability you want to enable, or the research you want to explore?

- What existing understanding of the problem has been developed?

  For a research proposal, this will briefly cover the most important related work in the space you are exploring.

  For a design proposal, this will introduce existing solutions, why they fall short, and the potential opportunity.
  
- What milestones will the group plan to accomplish?

  There are two milestone reports in the quarter, one early and one late.
  These are opportunities for feedback and guidance from staff and classmates.

  Explain what your group will plan to accomplish by each of these milestones.
  You will be asked to revisit these plans during those milestone reports.

- What might the group explicitly decide to omit?

  Progress requires compromise, as you cannot accomplish everything.
  Explain what aspects of the project you might choose to ignore or defer in this course.
  This is your opportunity to scope the project appropriately for this course.

#### Presentation

Each group will give a short in-class presentation of their proposal.
This is an opportunity for feedback from staff and classmates.
Your presentation should cover the same information as the document.

This is an opportunity for feedback, not a formal presentation. Please be appropriately candid, thoughtful, and engaged.

#### Submission

Due: Uploaded the night before class Thursday, January 14, 2016

Submit your document in PDF format.

<https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1021534/assignments/3121657>

Submit your presentation as no more than three slides in PDF, PPT, or PPTX format.

### Milestone Reports

Two milestone reports serve as a check on the trajectory of your project
and an opportunity for feedback and guidance from staff and classmates.
Convey the state of your project and your plans for the remainder of the quarter.

Milestone reports consist of a short document and a short in-class presentation.

#### Document

Prepare a one-page document addressing the following points:

- What you have done for this milestone, discussing current progress relative to previously stated plans.
- What you will do before your next milestone, including any adaptations based on your status or findings.
- Any areas where you could use advice or are blocked.

#### Presentation

Each group will give a short in-class presentation of their proposal.
This is an opportunity for feedback from staff and classmates.
Your presentation should cover the same information as the document.

This is an opportunity for feedback, not a formal presentation. Please be appropriately candid, thoughtful, and engaged.

#### Submission

Due: Uploaded the night before class Thursday, January 28, 2016 and Thursday, February 25, 2016.

Milestone 1 document: <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1021534/assignments/3143418>
Milestone 1 presentation: <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1021534/assignments/3143419>

Milestone 2 presentation: <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1021534/assignments/3164486>

Submit your document in PDF format.

Submit your presentation in PDF, PPT, or PPTX format.

### Final Report

Your final report should be presented in the same general structure as the papers you read this quarter:

- Introduction and Motivation
- Statement of Contributions
- Related Work
- Description / Methods / Results
- Discussion / Future Work / Conclusion

Format your report according to the SIGCHI Document Format:

<https://sigchi.github.io/Document-Formats/>

Your report should be 4 to 10 pages in length, excluding references.

Write according to the content you have.
Be appropriately thorough and precise in your presentation, but do not needlessly pad your text.
